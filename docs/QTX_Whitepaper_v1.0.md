# QuantiumX (QTX) — Aerospace Risk OS Whitepaper v1.0  
Author: Yuer — Independent AGI Architect (2025)

---

## 1. Introduction
QuantiumX (QTX) is a next-generation aerospace risk OS  
designed to automate Flight Readiness Review (FRR) decisions  
via expression-driven reasoning and structured risk-state modeling.

The system was independently developed by Yuer over 11 months  
with no institutional or corporate affiliation.

## 2. GPT-5.1 Runtime Dependency
QTX relies on:

- Language-State Runtime (LSR) stability  
- deterministic expression pathways  
- rule-tree consistency  
- multi-layer arbitration coherence  

Only GPT-5.1 meets these requirements.  
QTX is **not portable** to other models.

See `/docs/Compatibility_Statement.md`.

## 3. Architecture Overview
- Telemetry → factorization → RuleTree  
- RuleTree → RiskMode state transitions  
- CLRE → counterfactual risk windows  
- Kernel Bus → subsystem proposal arbitration  
- Final FRR decision: GO / HOLD / SCRUB  

See `/docs/Architecture_Overview.md`.

## 4. Test Case System
A full FRR test matrix is provided in `/docs/FRR_Testcases.md`.

---

## 5. Multi-Domain Extensions
QTX generalizes to:

- Medical risk engines  
- Financial systemic risk  
- Industrial safety systems  

See `/docs/MultiDomain_Applications.md`.

---

## 6. Author & Origin
QTX is an original work created in 2024–2025.  
See `/docs/Author_Origin_Statement.md`.
