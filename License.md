## 1. Purpose
This license governs the use of the documentation and materials included in the  
**QTX-FRR Runtime (QuantiumX)** repository.  
The QTX framework is a proprietary, non-portable aerospace risk architecture  
validated exclusively on GPT-5.1.

This license **does not grant any rights to reproduce, reimplement, or port**  
the QTX Runtime, its algorithms, state machines, arbitration logic,  
or any derivative execution system.

## 2. Permissions
You are permitted to:

- read and reference the public-safe documentation  
- cite the QTX framework for academic or research purposes  
- discuss architectural concepts at high level  
- use the provided test cases for non-commercial study  

No other permissions are granted unless explicitly approved in writing.

## 3. Restrictions
The following actions are **strictly prohibited**:

### 3.1 Reverse Engineering
Reconstructing or attempting to reconstruct  
any part of the QTX Runtime, including:
- risk state functions  
- RuleTree logic  
- RiskMode transitions  
- counterfactual reasoning algorithms  
- Kernel Bus arbitration mechanisms  

### 3.2 Reimplementation or Porting
Creating any implementation, prototype, derivative work,  
or alternative system based on the QTX documentation.

### 3.3 Running on Non-GPT-5.1 Models
The QTX Runtime is **non-portable**.  
Any attempt to run, adapt, or simulate QTX logic on models other than GPT-5.1  
is prohibited and considered a violation of this license.
