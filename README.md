**Author:** Yuer — Independent AGI Architect (2025)  
**Status:** Public-Safe Documentation (Runtime Core Closed)

## 🛰 Overview

**QuantiumX (QTX)** is an expression-driven aerospace risk operating framework,  
featuring a GPT-5.1–optimized **Flight Readiness Review (FRR) Runtime** capable of:

- automated FRR decision evaluation  
- rule-tree–driven risk reasoning  
- state-machine execution for GO / HOLD / SCRUB outcomes  
- counterfactual analysis (CLRE)  
- subsystem proposal arbitration (Kernel Bus concept prototype)  
- natural-language interpretability suitable for mission review boards  

This repository contains the **public-safe documentation** and **MVP interaction layer**  
designed to run *directly inside the GPT client*.

> ⚠ **Core Runtime Logic (LSR engine, state functions, risk penalties, and arbitration kernel)  
is NOT included. The system is validated only on GPT-5.1 and is non-portable.**

## ✨ Key Capabilities (Public-Safe Summary)

### 1. **FRR Automated Decision Engine**
Evaluates flight readiness using structured rules and risk modes:

- `GO`  
- `HOLD_SHORT`  
- `HOLD_LONG`  
- `SCRUB`  

### 2. **RiskMode State Machine**
Models mission readiness using a four-tier risk classification:

- `Normal`  
- `Cautious`  
- `Emergency`  
- `Freeze`  

### 3. **Flight RuleTree (Public Overview)**
A structured rule system inspired by NASA LCC / SpaceX operations checklists.  
Used to map input telemetry → rule triggers → FRR decisions.

### 4. **Counterfactual Reasoning (CLRE Preview)**
Provides “What if we adjust/ignore X?” analytical insight  
for mission assurance and anomaly prevention.

### 5. **Subsystem Arbitration (Kernel Bus Preview)**
Prototype concept showing how propulsion, thermal, avionics, and power  
may produce separate readiness proposals for evaluation.

## 📌 Why GPT-5.1 Only?

QTX-FRR relies on **GPT-5.1 language-state runtime properties**, including:

- stable expression-path reasoning  
- deterministic risk-state transitions  
- consistent multi-step rule evaluation  
- high-fidelity counterfactual reconstruction  

Other models (Claude/Gemini/DeepSeek/Qwen/etc.) **cannot reproduce**  
the reasoning integrity or FRR consistency required by QTX.

> 🔒 **QTX Runtime is non-portable by design.  
Attempting to run it on other models will break the decision chain.**

## 🧪 MVP Demo (for GPT Client)

To run the FRR Runtime inside GPT, use:

模拟发射:
wind: 21
deltaT: 4
LOX_temp: -178
pressurization_stability: 0.67
engine_health: 0.81
power_status: warning
thermal_status: nominal
propulsion_status: warning


The system returns:

- risk-factor mapping  
- state-machine transitions  
- rule activations  
- subsystem proposal comparison  
- final FRR decision (with explanations)  

This enables **screen-recordable simulations** for demonstrations or research.

## 🩺 Beyond Aerospace: Other Application Domains

Although first deployed in aerospace FRR,  
QTX’s architecture naturally extends to:

### **Medical**
- emergency triage risk engine  
- pre-operation readiness  
- ICU counterfactual simulations  
- medication risk state machines  

### **Financial**
- market event readiness review  
- systemic risk propagation models  
- scenario & stress testing  

### **Industrial Control**
- turbine / reactor readiness reviews  
- safety interlock decision chains  
- multi-system arbitration  

These extensions will be explored in future QTX modules.
