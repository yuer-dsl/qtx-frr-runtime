# QTX / QuantiumX — Technology Usage & Responsibility Notice

QuantiumX (QTX) is a research-oriented aerospace risk analysis system.
This project involves high-sensitivity topics such as automated FRR
decision support, state-machine-based risk modeling, subsystem arbitration,
and counterfactual failure reconstruction.

To ensure ethical, safe, and legally compliant use, the following
restrictions apply:

1. QTX may not be used by individuals, organizations, or entities that
   cannot be identified, audited, or held responsible for downstream usage.

2. QTX may not be used for military, defense, weapon systems, intelligence
   operations, or real-time launch decision authority unless the user is
   a legally recognized organization under proper regulatory oversight.

3. QTX must not be used as a final arbiter for real launch decisions.
   All decisions must remain under certified aerospace authorities.

4. Shadow authorization, covert deployment, or usage without traceable
   governance is strictly prohibited.

5. QTX’s runtime logic is validated ONLY on GPT-5.1 and must not be
   ported, reverse-engineered, or adapted to non-auditable models.

Use of this project implies acceptance of these conditions.
Violation may result in legal, ethical, or organizational consequences.
