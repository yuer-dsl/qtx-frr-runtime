# QuantiumX (QTX) — Aerospace Risk OS Whitepaper v1.0  
Author: Yuer — Independent AGI Architect (2025)

---

## 1. Introduction
QuantiumX (QTX) is a next-generation aerospace risk OS  
designed to automate Flight Readiness Review (FRR) decisions  
via expression-driven reasoning and structured risk-state modeling.

The system was independently developed by Yuer over 11 months  
with no institutional or corporate affiliation.

---

## 2. GPT-5.1 Runtime Dependency
QTX relies on:

- Language-State Runtime (LSR) stability  
- deterministic expression pathways  
- rule-tree consistency  
- multi-layer arbitration coherence  

Only GPT-5.1 meets these requirements.  
QTX is **not portable** to other models.

See `/docs/Compatibility_Statement.md`.

## 3. Architecture Overview
- Telemetry → factorization → RuleTree  
- RuleTree → RiskMode state transitions  
- CLRE → counterfactual risk windows  
- Kernel Bus → subsystem proposal arbitration  
- Final FRR decision: GO / HOLD / SCRUB  

See `/docs/Architecture_Overview.md`.

---

## 4. Test Case System
A full FRR test matrix is provided in `/docs/FRR_Testcases.md`.

---

## 5. Multi-Domain Extensions
QTX generalizes to:

- Medical risk engines  
- Financial systemic risk  
- Industrial safety systems  

See `/docs/MultiDomain_Applications.md`.

---

## 6. Author & Origin
QTX is an original work created in 2024–2025.  
See `/docs/Author_Origin_Statement.md`.

# QuantiumX (QTX) — High-Sensitivity Technology Governance Statement

QuantiumX (QTX) is an aerospace risk analysis and FRR automation research
framework developed by an independent AGI architect following eleven months
of continuous system-level experimentation, modeling, and validation.

Given the potential dual-use and high-impact nature of automated risk
assessment technologies in aerospace, this statement defines the ethical,
legal, and governance boundaries of QTX:

1. **Prohibited Entities**
   QTX shall not be licensed, transferred, or made available to any
   unverified, anonymous, or non-auditable individual or organization.

2. **Prohibited Domains**
   QTX shall not be deployed in military, defense, intelligence, or
   weapons platforms unless under explicit legal, bilateral, and
   transparent agreements recognized by international law.

3. **Decision Authority Restrictions**
   QTX may not be used as a final arbiter for any real-world launch,
   scrubbing, or mission-critical go/no-go determination. Certified human
   authorities must retain full responsibility.

4. **No Shadow Deployment**
   No “private authorization,” covert usage, backdoor integration, or
   deployment without contractual traceability is permitted.

5. **Model Compatibility Restriction**
   The QTX Runtime is validated exclusively on **GPT-5.1**. Use on other
   models voids all guarantees, safety assumptions, interpretability
   properties, and responsibility frameworks.

These guidelines exist to protect global safety, the integrity of this
research, and the developer.
