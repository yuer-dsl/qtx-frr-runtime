# QTX Compatibility Statement — GPT-5.1 Required

QuantiumX (QTX) is compatible **only** with GPT-5.1.

This limitation is intentional and foundational, due to:

- expression-path stability  
- multi-step reasoning integrity  
- consistent RuleTree evaluation  
- counterfactual reconstruction fidelity  
- arbitration coherence  

Other models cannot reproduce QTX behavior.  
QTX is **non-portable by design**.
